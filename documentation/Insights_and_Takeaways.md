# Insights & Takeaways

## Overview
This section summarizes the key findings derived from both the historical churn analysis and the predicted churn output.

Insights focus on identifying **consistent churn drivers** as well as **emerging risk patterns** that may not be fully visible through historical data alone.

---

## Contract Type as a Core Churn Driver
Customers on **month-to-month contracts** represent the largest share of churn historically, accounting for approximately **47% of churned customers**.

This same contract type also dominates the predicted churn population by a significant margin.

The consistency between historical and predicted churn suggests that **contract structure is a structural churn driver** rather than a temporary pattern. Customers with lower contractual commitment remain more sensitive to churn risk.

---

## Tenure: Multiple High-Risk Periods
Historical churn is concentrated among customers with **24 months or more of tenure**, indicating that churn is not limited to early-stage customers.

The predicted churn output reinforces this pattern while also highlighting customers in the **6–12 month tenure range** as an additional risk segment.

This indicates that churn risk occurs at **multiple points in the customer lifecycle**, including both mid-term evaluation phases and longer-term customer fatigue stages.

---

## Payment Method: Shifting Risk Patterns
Historical churn is most strongly associated with customers using **mailed check** as a payment method.

However, the predicted churn results identify **credit card payments** as the dominant payment method among customers at risk.

This shift suggests that churn drivers may **evolve over time**. While historical data reflects past operational friction, the predictive output highlights emerging risk patterns that may require different retention strategies.

---

## Services and Product Experience
Customers using **fiber optic services** account for a higher share of historical churn, representing approximately **41% of churned customers**.

This pattern could not be fully validated within the predicted churn dataset.

As a result, service-related churn is treated as a **supporting insight rather than a primary driver**, indicating potential product experience issues that warrant further investigation.

---

## Demographics: Limited Predictive Power
Female customers represent a slightly higher proportion of churn in both historical and predicted data.

However, age group patterns are not consistent between historical churn and predicted churn.

This suggests that while certain demographic attributes may be associated with churn, **demographics alone are not reliable predictors** and should be interpreted in combination with behavioral and contractual factors.

---

## Model Validation Through Consistency
The predictive model largely reinforces the key churn drivers observed in historical data, particularly **contract type and tenure**.

At the same time, it introduces new signals, such as **shifting payment method risk**, that are not immediately visible through historical analysis alone.

This balance indicates that the model is effectively **extending historical insights rather than merely replicating them**.

---

## Business Implications
- Contract structure should be a primary focus of churn reduction strategies  
- Retention efforts should target **multiple lifecycle stages**, not only new customers  
- Payment-related churn drivers may evolve and require continuous monitoring  
- Predictive insights enable **proactive targeting rather than reactive analysis**
