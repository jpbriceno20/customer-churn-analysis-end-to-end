# Machine Learning Overview

## Role of the Model
The purpose of the machine learning model in this project is to identify customers who are likely to churn. While historical analysis explains past behavior, the model is used to anticipate future churn, allowing the analysis to move from **descriptive to predictive**.

---

## Type of Prediction
The model performs a **classification task**, identifying individual customers who are likely to churn.

A customer classified as **predicted churn** is one whose profile and behavior indicate a higher likelihood of becoming a lost customer.

---

## Information Used for Prediction
The model uses a combination of customer attributes related to:
- Contract characteristics  
- Revenue and charges  
- Service usage  
- Customer profile variables  

These variables are relevant from a business perspective, as income levels, contract types, and service characteristics are commonly associated with churn behavior.

---

## Model Selection: Random Forest
A **Random Forest** model was selected due to its wide adoption in business applications and its ease of interpretation at a high level.

This type of model is commonly used in large organizations for classification problems and does not introduce unnecessary complexity for the scope of this project.

The focus was on applying a **reliable and practical model** rather than developing a custom algorithm from scratch.

---

## Model Output
The output of the model is a **CSV file** containing a list of customers identified as potential churners.

This format was chosen because it is simple, flexible, and easy to integrate with reporting tools.

The CSV approach also allows multiple prediction scenarios to be generated by adjusting model parameters or inputs without changing the overall workflow.

---

## Integration with Power BI
The predicted churn dataset is consumed directly by Power BI and presented in a dedicated dashboard.

This enables segmentation and analysis of high-risk customers by attributes such as:
- Gender  
- Contract type  
- Service characteristics  

The dashboard supports decision-making related to marketing focus, contract adjustments, and retention strategies.

---

## Scope and Limitations of the Model
The model is not intended to be deployed in a production environment or used for real-time scoring.

It does not attempt advanced optimization or complex feature engineering.

This level of modeling is sufficient to support business analysis and decision-making while keeping the solution **simple, interpretable, and aligned with the overall project objectives**.
