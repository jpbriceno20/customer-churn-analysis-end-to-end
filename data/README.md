# Data Notes

This project uses customer-level transactional and account data to support churn analysis.

## Raw Data Availability
Raw datasets are not included in this repository to keep the project portfolio-focused and to avoid sharing large or sensitive files.

## Data Scope
The analysis is based on structured customer data typically found in subscription-based businesses, including:
- Customer account attributes
- Contract and tenure information
- Service usage indicators
- Billing and payment-related fields

## Data Preparation
All data cleaning and preparation steps were performed using SQL prior to analysis and modeling.
The SQL scripts included in this repository document the full data preparation workflow.

## Privacy
The data used in this project is either simulated or anonymized.
No real customer-identifiable or proprietary company data is shared.
